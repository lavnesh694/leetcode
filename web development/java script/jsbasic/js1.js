// java sccript is a dynamically typed language mean a variable is created without a specific type other than c++ and java
// c++ and java is statically typed language mean a variable is created with a specific data type

// now learn about let and var
// the scope of let is local means only code blocks but var is created globally means whole code can used it
// we cannot redeclare let we we can redeclare var

//const is also used locally and initialization is complusory while creating a const but it is not compulsory in case of let and var

// Generaly we declare variable in camel case for ex iLoveYOU means first alphabet of first first word is small and other first alphabet is large
